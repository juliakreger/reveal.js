Title:
How to get a cross-project feature landed in OpenStack 
Or how I plotted to obtain success...

Abstract:

A little over two years ago, I was told in a Vancouver conference center meeting room, "Two others have tried to propose that feature, but they have both failed". I knew it was the right path to take. I knew people in the room and the larger community wanted to go in that direction. The question was how?

In this this talk, I'll cover my experience building consensus on design, setting expectations across the community, and rallying people together to reach critical mass to land a complex cross project feature in a project such as OpenStack.

						OpenStack could be described as a conglomerate of projects.
						Some official, some not so much.
						Many projects have specific focus areas, and may have dependencies.
						A cross project feature is a feature that involves two or more projects in concert.
