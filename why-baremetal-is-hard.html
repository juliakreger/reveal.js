As clouds grow in popularity, so does the idea of using bare metal hardware directly as clouds, or flexible cloud infrastructure. It can be done, it can be done quite well! But there are always some snags, gotchas, and other pain points that exist. With an understanding of these pitfalls and architectural headaches, an "operator" will have greater success leveraging [OpenStack Ironic][https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ironic] to build their perfect bare metal cloud.

The headaches that are provisioning baremetal are not widely known. We want compute resources, we don't really care how we get them, and often we get an ip address,But unless your a seasoned in the fine arts of racking, stacking, servers, or at least your employer's specific way of racking, stacking, and cabling servers... you have no visibility or insight into how that server goes from a cardboard box to networked!

					Cabling in it's self can be a complex step. Identifying cabling, identifying addresses, mapping to ports.
					And some organizations require redundant cabling.... And then you get redundant redundant!
					And some groups often don't wish to share access or resources to achieve a gaol. politics()
					Thou shall not have "Top of Rack" switch access. Thou shall not add your own VLANs or new networks without form 34b filed!

				<aside class="notes">It is easy for a vendor's version of a code base to become stale and evolve into a collection of patches that are not fully tested, or that is tested with their "ideal" path in mind. With upstream open source, the communities can generally get you a fix just as quickly, or maybe your issue was already fixed.

				<p>Flat Networks</p>
				<img width="75%" heigth="75%" data-src="/images/FlatNetwork.png" class="plain">
				<aside class="notes">The largest hurdle is network architecture, and how to connect machines. This form is called flat networking, meaning all of the machines are connected to the same broadcast domain. This is particullarly useful if you have no isolation requirements between nodes, or if you are managing a single tenant environment. They can also be useful for mass machine deployment, along the lines of the Bifrost tooling.</aside>
